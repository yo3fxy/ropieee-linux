This driver comes from: https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au

The 'Makefile' needs to be changed:

CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = n
CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM_RPI = y

history:
--------

2020/12/09: switch back to driver from https://github.com/gordboy/rtl8812au-5.9.3.2
            reason is that with the latest 5.4 kernel the 8812au driver does not work (tested with the TP-Link Archer T4U)
